\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Qualitative analysis}
Results showed that:

65\% of answers were rated as “Relevant”,

25\% as “Partially relevant”,

10\% as “Not relevant”.

Feedback indicated that relevance dropped when:

the query used ambiguous phrasing,

or too few document chunks were retrieved due to vector sparsity.

Users appreciated:

the traceability of answers via citations,

the lightweight UI,

and the multilingual support.
